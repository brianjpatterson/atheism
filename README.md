Questions for Atheists

There is just one question in this program.   And just one correct answer.

That correct answer should lead you to realize that our cosmology is not materialistic.

I think it's funny when atheists ask religious people how they can presume to know what happens when you die?  But, isn't that what atheists are doing as well?  Hubris and Ego are quite funny sometimes,  but in the end, not so much.
